### Background

### Time-line

By June 2015: We propose to have in place a well-designed methodology for analysing twelve months worth of images captured from camera-monitored boat ramps around Port Phillip Bay.

### Project Scope

(1) Front end image storage and database access. **Key Questions** What type of database will (or is) being used to store the access the images? How are the images named and/or tagged so that they can be indexed?

(2) Optimum sampling design based on analyses of twelve months data.
