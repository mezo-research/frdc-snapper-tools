## Overview
The Victorian snapper fishery is divided into eastern and western stocks: these two stocks are managed separately by the Department of Environment and Primary Industries(Fisheries Victoria).This assessment focusses on the *Western Victorian* snapper fishery which encompasses waters from the west of Wilsons Promontory to the South Australian and Victorian border, including Port Phillip Bay and Western Port Bay. The Victorian snapper fishery is multi-sectoral (it comprises both commercial and recreational components) and multi-jurisdictional (the commercial sector is subject to Victorian and Commonwealth licensing arrangements). 

Integrated stock assessment modelling of the form presented here, allows for quantitative assessments of fish stocks drawing on multiple data sets. This is the first time integrated stock assessment modelling techniques have been used to assess Victoriaâ€™s western snapper stock. Mezo Research was engaged to assess the status of the stock to afford better long-term management of the fishery.

## Assessment Model
The 2013 snapper stock assessment model is implemented using Stock Synthesis Version 3 [Methot and Wetzel, 2013](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.fishres.2012.10.012). The base-case model files available here (see the `BC` folder) are configured to describe a one-stock, one-area fishery with multiple 'fleets', and thus draws upon the 'areas as fleets' [Cope and Punt, 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.002) method to account for multiple ...
