## Overview
The Victorian snapper fishery is divided into eastern and western stocks for management purposes. Each stock is managed separately by the Department of Environment and Primary Industries (Fisheries Victoria). This project focusses on the Western Victorian snapper stock which encompasses waters from the west of Wilsons Promontory to the South Australian and Victorian border, including Port Phillip Bay and Western Port Bay. The Victorian snapper fishery is multi-sectoral (it comprises both commercial and recreational components) and multi-jurisdictional (the commercial sector is subject to both Victorian and Commonwealth licensing arrangements).

## Assessment Modelling
A pilot stock assessment model for the Western Victorian snapper stock is implemented using Stock Synthesis Version 3 (SS3, [Methot and Wetzel, 2013](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.fishres.2012.10.012)) Test-case models (see `folder` assess) are configured to describe a single-stock, single-area fishery with multiple fishing and survey 'fleets'. This approach draws upon the 'areas as fleets' method to account for spatial disagregation among fishery and survey based data sources ([Cope and Punt, 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.002)).

Integrated stock assessment modelling permits quantitative analyses of fish stocks whilst drawing upon multiple data sets. This is the first time integrated stock assessment modelling techniques have been used to assess Victoriaâ€™s western snapper stock. The development of a suite of modelling tools for stock assessment and simulation of the Western Victorian snapper stock will enable better long-term management of this important fishery.

## Simulation Testing
A simulation testing framework for the Western Victorian snapper stock is being developed with the use of `ss3sim`, an R package that facilitates reproducible, flexible, and rapid end-to-end simulation testing with SS3 ([Anderson et al. 2014](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092725)).

## Management Strategy Evaluation
The development of a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) framework and modelling tool for the Western Victorian Snapper stock is scheduled for 2015. MSE is a technique for assessing the performance of alternative management procedures against pre-defined objectives; MSE modelling frameworks allow managers and other stakeholders to test a range of management procedures and performance indicators in both a conceptual and simulation modelling context. Management objectives in a fishery context often encompass ecological, social, and economic dimensions, meaning a range of considerations must be made when developing a fishery MSE framework.  In a real-world fishery, only one management strategy can be implemented at any given time. So that alternative candidate management strategies can be compared, MSE typically employs simulation modelling of a fishery and its biological and/or socioeconomic components. The MSE approach explicitly seeks to identify and model uncertainties, and to improve understanding of how those uncertainties may affect performance measures and thus management. The development of an MSE framework for the Western Vitotrian Snapper stock will therefore allow fishery managers, scientists,industry representatives, and other key stakeholders to ...

### Candidate Harvest Strategies
A wide range of harvest strategies, harvest control rules, and management procedures are employed around the world for fisheries mangement. The following is list of canditate harvest strategies for the Western Victorian Snapper Stock. 

1. Input based control
2. Output based control
3. Do nothing
4. Do something

## Recreational Fishing Effort Survey
Fisheries Victoria is currently developing a new, camera-based monitoring program for the recreational component of the Western Victorian Snapper Fishery. Using video cameras at five major boat ramps in Port Phillip Bay, Fisheries Victoria are collecting approximately one image per minutes for each camera. This image capture rate will result in approximately 1 million stored images by mid 2015. As comprehensive human analysis of this many images is infeasible, a subsampling methodology and image analsysis technique will be required. Mezo Research will investigate alternative techniques for sampling image data and develop simple methods for extracting and analysing images from a SQL database (or similar). Key questions to be considered include:

1. What level of survey sampling is required to provide an accurate and reliable estimate of total fishing effort?
2. What are the relative cost implications of human checking vs image recognition software?
3. How should the current camera arrangement be modified to ensure good results from future surveys?

Software-based data sampling methods require skill-testing against human-validated results before they can be relibaly used to provide estimates of fishing effort. Mezo Research will undertake this component of the Western Victorian Snapper Modelling Project in close cooperation with Fisheries Victoria in 2015.
