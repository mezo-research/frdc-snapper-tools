# Stock Assesssment

Stock assessment for Australian pink snapper stocks is wide and varied.

## Western Victorian Stock

The Victorian snapper fishery is divided into an eastern and western stock: these two stocks are managed separately by the Department of Environment and Primary Industries (Fisheries Victoria).This assessment focusses on the *Western Victorian* snapper fishery which encompasses waters to the west of Wilsons Promontory to the South Australian border, including Port Phillip and Western Port bays. The Victorian snapper fishery is multi-sectoral (it comprises both commercial and recreational components) and multi-jurisdictional (the commercial sector is subject to Victorian and Commonwealth licensing arrangements). 

Integrated stock assessment modelling allows for quantitative assessments of fish stocks drawing on multiple data sets. This is the first time integrated stock assessment modelling techniques have been used to assess Victoriaâ€™s western snapper stock. Mezo Research was engaged to assess the status of the stock using modern quantitative stock assessment modelling techniques to aid in the better long-term management of the fishery.
