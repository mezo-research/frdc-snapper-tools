## Overview
The Victorian snapper fishery is divided into eastern and western stocks for management purposes. The two stocks are managed separately by the Department of Environment and Primary Industries (Fisheries Victoria). This project focusses on the *Western Victorian* snapper fishery which encompasses waters from the west of Wilsons Promontory to the South Australian and Victorian border, including Port Phillip Bay and Western Port Bay. The Victorian snapper fishery is multi-sectoral (it comprises both commercial and recreational components) and multi-jurisdictional (the commercial sector is subject to both Victorian and Commonwealth licensing arrangements).

## Assessment Modelling
The Western Victorian snapper stock assessment model is implemented using Stock Synthesis Version 3 (SS3, [Methot and Wetzel, 2013](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.fishres.2012.10.012)). The base-case model files available here (see the `BC` folder) are configured to describe a one-stock, one-area fishery with multiple 'fleets', and thus draws upon the 'areas as fleets' method to account for the spatially disagregated stock ([Cope and Punt, 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.002)).

Integrated stock assessment modelling of the form presented here, allows for quantitative assessments of fish stocks drawing on multiple data sets. This is the first time integrated stock assessment modelling techniques have been used to assess Victoriaâ€™s western snapper stock. The development of state-of-the-art stock assessment and simulation tools for the Western Victorian snapper stock will provide key fishery stakeholders provide better long-term management of the fishery.

## Simulation Testing
A simulation testing framework for the Western Victorian snapper stock is being developed with the use of `ss3sim`, an R package that facilitates reproducible, flexible, and rapid end-to-end simulation testing with SS3 ([Anderson et al. 2014](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092725)).

## Management Strategy Evaluation
The development of a Management Strategy Evaluation for the Western Victorian Snapper stock is scheduled for 2015.
